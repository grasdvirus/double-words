# **App Name**: Double Words

## Core Features:

- Level Challenge: Presents a linguistic challenge for each level, requiring the user to create a word or phrase with specific letter combinations (e.g., 'ee', 'rr', 'oo').
- Input and Validation: Provides a virtual keyboard and text input field for users to compose their words/phrases, validating whether the input meets the level's criteria and if it's a real word using an external dictionary API.
- Originality Bonus Tool: Checks the database using the LLM for unique words or phrases to award bonus points, encouraging creativity.
- Score Tracking & Leaderboard: Tracks user scores, displays a leaderboard of top players, and allows users to view their game history and earn linguistic badges.
- Settings Customization: Allows users to adjust game settings such as language, theme (dark/light mode), and sound volume, as well as reset their progress or access a quick tutorial.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) for buttons, providing a sense of achievement and highlighting interactive elements.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) to give a modern feel and make the gold color stand out, while being easier on the eyes during longer gameplay.
- Accent color: Green (#4CAF50) for correct answer feedback; this color is significantly brighter and more saturated, to contrast well against the background. Red (#F44336) for incorrect answer feedback.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern and clean look, suitable for both the game interface and any text elements. 
- Subtle animations for user feedback, like a gentle bounce of the keyboard keys upon interaction and confetti bursts for combo achievements.
- A clean, minimalist layout that places the game challenge at the top, a clear input area in the middle, and a virtual keyboard at the bottom.
